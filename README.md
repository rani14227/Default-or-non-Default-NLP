# Default-or-non-default---NNLP---Project
In this problem, you will predict the probability of the person or customer defaulting and then go on to classify them as defaulters or non-defaulters. Use a sequential Neural Network model (Feed Forward) to classify the outcome (Defaulter vs Non Defaulter).
